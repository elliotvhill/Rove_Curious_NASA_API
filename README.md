## Pull a picture from the Mars Curiosity rover
Users can click a button to pull a random picture from the Curiosity rover library. The images are all from the rover's Mast camera system _(The Mast Camera-- [Mastcam](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/mastcam/) for short -- takes color images and videos of the Martian terrain and is mounted about 6.5 feet off the ground)_. The page will also show the title of the photo, a brief description, as well as other information.
